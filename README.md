# genome-contextual-colors
Contextual colors allows the creation of white-label design system components and supports dark-mode. Unfortunately, there is no unified standard on how to name these colors. Using the genome color optimization and semantic+weighted palettes, this is an attempt to find common ground and begin a community-wide process of participation to achieve standardization.

#RULES
1. All colors (palette and contextul) are prefixed with a two to three alpha representation of the design system name. Here, we'll prefix with 'Genome' or gnm.
2. Pallete colors are identified with 'palette', or 'gnm-palette'. This is a signal to developers they should not directly reference in components.
3. Contextual colors are identified with 'color', or 'gnm-color' and are preferred for consumption by components.
