# genome-contextual-colors
Contextual colors allows the creation of white-label design system components and supports dark-mode. Unfortunately, there is no unified standard on how to name these colors. Using the genome color optimization and semantic+weighted palettes, this is an attempt to find common ground and begin a community-wide process of participation to achieve standardization.
